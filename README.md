# PygTranslator

PygLatin or Pig Latin, is a language game in which words in English are altered. The objective is to hide the words from others not familiar with the rules (as if you were speaking a different language). 

# How does it work?

1-) If a word starts with a consonant, take the first letter of said word, and put it in the end (ex: Playstation -> Laystationp). Afterwards, add a "ay" at the end (ex: Playstation -> Laystationp -> LaystationPay).

2-) If the word starts with a vowel, don't rearrange the words, but simply add "way" at the end of the word! (ex: Erick -> Erickway)


The program works the same way! Input a word, and you get the translated version!

# How do I run it?
